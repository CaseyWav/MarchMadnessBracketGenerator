I wanted to have a little fun and learn about Python, and I wanted to generate hundreds of thousands March Madness Brackets. I have doing this for 3 years now.


For 2025, I wanted to incorporate weighted odds, so I am using a team's seed and the historical win percentage for each round to weight the "coin toss".
I generated 1.5 million brackets, and 1 of them lasted 37 games.


---------My 2023 & 2024 version did a 50/50 coin toss to decide who won----------
The odds of having a perfect bracket in this manner are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 or so.

In 2024, I generated 1,050,000 brackets. I was able to get a bracket that lasted the first four games and first 16 games.

In 2023, I was able to get about 12-15 games before all 500,000 brackets I generated were incorrect.
